# avaloncoin
Avaloncoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. avalon uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Avalon Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.


The Avaloncoin project is launched based on the hard work and continuous effort of over 400 Bitcoin developers who made over 14,000 commits over the life to date of the Bitcoin project. We are eternally grateful to you for your efforts and diligence in making a secure network and for their support of free and open source software development. The Avaloncoin experiment is made on the foundation you built.

Thank you to the Bitcoin developers.

Abstract Avaloncoin aims to implement a blockchain which is optimized specifically for the use case of transferring assets such as securities from one holder to another. Based on the extensive development and testing of Bitcoin, Avaloncoin is built on a fork of the Bitcoin code. Key changes include a faster block reward time and a change in the number, but not weighed distribution schedule, of coins. Avaloncoin is free and open source and will be issued and mined transparently with no pre-mine, developer allocation or any other similar set aside. Avaloncoin is intended to prioritize user control, privacy and censorship resistance and be jurisdiction agnostic while allowing simple optional additional features for users based on need.
A blockchain is a ledger showing the value of something and allowing it to be transferred to someone else. Of all the possible uses for blockchains, the reporting of who owns what is one of the core uses of the technology. This is why the first and most successful use case for blockchain technology to date has been Bitcoin.


Avaloncoin (AVL) is a Proof of Work coin built on the Bitcoin UTXO model. As with other Bitcoin derivatives, AVL coins are distributed to persons augmenting the Avalon network by mining Avalon.
